# **The Neural Quest Interface (NQI)**

### **‚ú® Where scattered thoughts become structured adventures ‚ú®**

**The Neural Quest Interface (NQI)** is a neurodivergent-affirming personal project
management system designed to work _with_ your brain, not against it. It transforms
the often overwhelming process of managing personal projects and hobbies into a
series of engaging, achievable quests.

Built on the principles of the **Quest-Based Agile** framework, NQI provides the
external scaffolding needed to bridge the gap between brilliant ideas and
tangible accomplishments, especially for those with executive function challenges
like ADHD.

## **üéØ Key Features**

- **The Quest Board:** A visual, six-column Kanban-style board that guides you
  from a fleeting idea to a celebrated accomplishment.
- **WIP Limit of 1:** Enforces monotasking by allowing only one quest "In-Progress"
  at a time, eliminating overwhelm and promoting deep focus.
- **Gamification Engine:** Earn Experience Points (XP) for completing quests, unlock
  custom rewards from your own "Reward Shop," and earn badges for consistency.
- **Zero-Knowledge Security:** Your data is end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) on your devices
  before it ever touches our servers. We can't see your data, period.
- **Cross-Platform:** Use NQI seamlessly across all your devices (Desktop, Mobile,
  and Web).
- **100% Open Source:** NQI is free, open-source software licensed under the AGPL-3.
  You can inspect the code, contribute to its development, and host it on your own
  server.
