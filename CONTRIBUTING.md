## **How Can I Contribute?**

### **Reporting Bugs**

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug has not already been reported by
searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/rghsoftware/nqi_frontend/issues).
If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/rghsoftware/nqi_frontend/issues/new).
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case**
demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

Please use the **Bug Report** template when creating the issue.

### **Suggesting Enhancements**

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one,
we'd love to hear it\! Please check the existing [Issues](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/rghsoftware/nqi_frontend/issues)
to see if your idea has been discussed. If not, please [open a new issue](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/rghsoftware/nqi_frontend/issues/new)
using the **Feature Request** template.

### **Your First Code Contribution**

Unsure where to begin contributing to NQI? You can start by looking through good
first issue and help wanted issues:

- **Good First Issue** \- issues which should only require a few lines of code,
  and a test or two.
- **Help Wanted** \- issues which should be a bit more involved than 'good first
  issue' issues.

## **Pull Request Process**

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from main.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, **add tests**.
3. If you've changed APIs, **update the documentation**.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request\!

## **Style Guides**

### **Git Commit Messages**

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### **Code Style**

The NQI project will adhere to standard style guides for the languages used (Go
for the backend, Dart/Flutter for the frontend). We will configure linters to
enforce these styles automatically. Please ensure your code passes the linter
checks before submitting a pull request.
